# DroneSignalAnalysis
This repository contains MATLAB scripts  of the Drone Signal Dataset found in IEEE DataPort
The Initial scripts provided by the DataSet creators were for normal operation 
This script does a bunch of signal operations to get a bit more in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the signals in questions
and uses MATLAB's built in <I>"gpuArray"</I> function and <I>"gather"</I> functions to move data from GPU to COU for ease of analysis.
